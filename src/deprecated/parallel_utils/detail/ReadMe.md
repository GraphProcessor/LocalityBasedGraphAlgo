##Thread Pool
- [Thread Poll Intro](detail/ThreadPoolIntro.md)

###Important Status Variables
- is_ready_finishing_, managed by master thread, set true only when all current-stage-tasks finished
- is_finished_, manged by master thread, set true only when current worker-thread_list_ are joined

##Breakable Thread Pool
###Traits
- Could not let master thread add tasks when it is break
- Could not let other thread_list_ acquire tasks when it is break
- Before Resume the tasks, the master thread is required to reset the is_break flag

###Solved Bugs
- After Break, the master thread can also add tasks, which make all thread_list_ busy again, logical error(Solved)
- Break in advance, but the flag is_break_ is not set, then the boss is able to add another task(Solved)

###Current Bugs
- new finding:   
```cpp
boss_wait_cond_var_.wait(lock);
```   
not awake again...
- after several bulk-sync-phase, dead-lock(but sharp change of left_task_counter_ is only executed after the is_break_ flag set true)
- bug in next_ta   sk() function call
- also bug in is_break, there is possibility that a thread is going to issue is_break signal
- still bug in thread_pool_base, not successful one time

###Thinking
- the necessity of the atomic_int left_tasks_counter_, puzzling???
    - Answer: it is used to track whether any thread is busy with task, so maybe it is necessary
