- [yche_exp.py](demo_files/yche_exp.py), some experimental codes is put in this file

##Demo Codes: 

content | detail
--- | ---
[gexpmq.py](demo_files/gexpmq.py) | A demonstration of the Gauss-Seidel coordinate relaxation scheme
[hr_relax.py](demo_files/hr_relax.py) | A demonstration of a relaxation method for computing a heat-kernel based community


##Heat Kernel Growth(With Relax)
- Code: [algo_hr_grow.py](main_files/algo_hr_grow.py), code is refactored by Yulin CHE to make it more easier to understand

- Authors:

> by Kyle Kloster and David F. Gleich
> supported by NSF award CCF-1149756.

- Description:

> This demo shows our algorithm running on the Twitter graph.
> Our other codes are available from David's website:
>
>   https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/codes/hkgrow/
>
> To use this demo, you need pylibbvg graph by David Gleich, Wei-Yen Day, and
> Yongyang Yu (heavily based on webgraph by Sebastiano Vigna -- he did all the
> fundamental work!) as well as the symmetrized version of the twitter graph.
>
> If you are on a mac or linux, run
>
>   pip install pylibbvg
>   wget https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/data/twitter-2010-symm.graph
>   wget https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/data/twitter-2010-symm.offsets
>   wget https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/data/twitter-2010-symm.properties
>
> Then, as long as these files are in your directory, our code will run!
>
> You need about 4-5GB of space and memory to run this demo.

- Code: [algo_ppr.py](main_files/algo_ppr.py), code is refactored by Yulin CHE to make it more easier to understand

- Bug, should update first

```python
            for neighbor_v in self.graph[v]:
                if neighbor_v not in r_dict:
                    r_dict[neighbor_v] = 0.
                if r_dict[neighbor_v] < len(self.graph[neighbor_v]) * self.tolerance <= r_dict[neighbor_v] + mass:
                    task_queue.append(neighbor_v)
                r_dict[neighbor_v] += mass
```
